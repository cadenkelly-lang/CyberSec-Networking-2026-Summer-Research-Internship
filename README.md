# Cybersecurity Networking Training Modules — Summer 2026

## Project Overview

This repository contains documentation, diagrams, and training materials developed during my Summer 2026 research internship with the Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP).

The project focuses on developing cybersecurity training modules for rural Alaskan Communities. The goal is to create accessible, cost-effective, hands-on cybersecurity education through a virtualized cyber range environment covering networking fundamentals (with a focus on network segmentation), system administration, and firewall configuration.

The training environment uses virtualization and network simulation to allow students to explore real-world networking and cybersecurity concepts in a controlled environment.

## Project Architecture

The project network architecture is documented at both the physical (Layer 1) and logical (Layer 3) levels.

### Layer 1 — Physical Network Architecture

The Layer 1 diagram shows the physical components of the training environment, including servers, switches, network connections, and hardware organization.

### Layer 3 — Logical Network Architecture

The Layer 3 diagram shows the logical network design, including IP addressing, network segmentation, student stations, and firewall boundaries.
